= GNU Make Gradle Plugin

Provides a wrapper for calling GNU Make from Gradle. This is especially useful
for projects migrating to Gradle or when constructing complex build systems of which
some components utilise GNU make as it build tool. Most common command-line switches
are supported, but for full flexibiliy it is possible to add any additional switch via 
the *switches* property.

== Synopsis
[source,groovy]
----

buildscript { 
  repositories {
	jcenter()
  }  
  dependencies {
    classpath 'org.ysb33r.gradle:gnumake:0.3'
  }
}

import org.ysb33r.gradle.gnumake.GnuMakeBuild

task runMake (type:GnuMakeBuild) {
  targets = ['build','install']
  flags = [ DESTDIR : '/copy/files/here', BUILD_NUMBER : 12345 ]
}
----

It is also possible to set the executable and makefile name globally for all tasks

[source,groovy]
----
gnumake {
  executable = 'gmake'
  makefile = 'OurOwnMakefileConvention'
}
----

If the above two are not set in a task it will take the value from the global configuration.
